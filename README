Hello ya'll

This is a small c program I wrote to write things to the gllog that two
different scripts of mine use.

It should be set as post_check in your glftpd.conf

There are a few variables in a few #defines in the beginning of the c file,
be sure to check those out (paths and stufF).

After you fixed the config, install like so:

make install DEST=<destination>

And a real example:
make install DEST=/jail/glftpd/bin/

With this package (so far) rud-mkvsize.tcl is included, it needs to be fixed
a bit though to work as a pzs-ng plugin and load itself and so on.

For now, copy it somewhere into your bot and source it after your pzs-ng and
it should work.

There's no config at all in it yet, so if you want to change anything with
output or so, please hack it.


Best regards
rudenstam
