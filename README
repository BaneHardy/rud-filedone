Hello ya'll

This is a small c program I wrote to write things to the gllog that two different scripts of mine use.

It should be set as post_check in your glftpd.conf

There are a few variables in a few #defines in the beginning of the c file, be sure to check those out (paths and stufF).

After you fixed the config, install like so:

make install DEST=<destination>

And a real example:
make install DEST=/jail/glftpd/bin/
